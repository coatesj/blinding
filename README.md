# blinding
Short script for blinding a folder of images. Requires python 3.0.

Save script to a specific folder, navigate to that folder in cmd and then run the script, specifying the folder to be blinded

Slightly more specific instructions:
Open cmd in windows
Cd (Drag folder containing script here) # Sets directory
py blinding.py # Will run the script. 

Adapted from a script I've used for a number of years - I'm not sure where the original came from but it was depreciated with python 3.0
